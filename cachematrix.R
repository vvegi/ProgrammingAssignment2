## This code is used to find the inverse of a square matrix by using cache i.e, 
## if inverse is cached and will not be calculated repeatedly
## This code almost uses similar structure that is provided in the example code(to calculate mean)
## It is assumed that the non singular matrices are provided to this function

## 
## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to
##              -set the value of the matrix
##              -get the value of the matrix
##              -set the value of the inverse
##              -get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getinverse <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "vector" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of 
## the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(m)
        m
        
}
